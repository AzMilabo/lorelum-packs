title: Define the Decisions the Pack Should Improve
---

## When to apply

Apply before choosing Practices when the proposed Pack is still described as a subject such as
"PostgreSQL operations" or "frontend accessibility." Decide what judgment the collection should
improve and for whom. Identifying when that help is needed comes next; this Practice defines the
result of the collection, not its retrieval moments.

## Guidance

Write one outcome sentence naming the intended reader, the recurring decisions they face, and how
the Pack should improve those choices. Test each candidate topic against that sentence: if knowing
the topic would not change one of those decisions, it does not belong merely for completeness.
Narrow or separate unrelated decision families instead of hiding them under a broad domain name.
Stop when the outcome can admit useful guidance and reject impressive but irrelevant coverage.

## Anti-pattern

A team wants a database-operations Pack that reduces avoidable production incidents. The source
repository is organized into backup, replication, indexing, and configuration chapters, so copying
that table of contents looks comprehensive and easy to review. The author makes one Practice for
every chapter and calls the Pack complete. A database operator asking whether a risky schema change
can be rolled back receives definitions from several chapters but no guidance for that decision. The
better outcome would name the operational choices the Pack should improve, then include source
topics only when they support those choices.

## Why

A Pack organized around a decision outcome has a stable reason for including or excluding content. A
topic inventory can grow indefinitely while still failing to help at the moment a reader must
choose.

## Exceptions and boundaries

Early research may begin with a provisional outcome and refine it as real needs appear. A Pack may
serve several related decision families when the relationship is explicit; it should not force
unrelated audiences into one collection. This Practice does not choose individual `applies_when`
text or require a fixed number of Practices.

## Example

An accessibility Pack is intended for frontend reviewers. The author states: "Help reviewers decide
whether a proposed interface change preserves keyboard use, focus visibility, and understandable
control names before approval." Color theory and general visual branding may be useful subjects, but
they do not enter this Pack unless they change one of those review decisions. The outcome is
specific enough to guide discovery without dictating the final Practice list.
