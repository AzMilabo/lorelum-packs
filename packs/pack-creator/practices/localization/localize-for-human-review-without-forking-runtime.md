title: Localize for Human Review without Forking Runtime Meaning
---

## When to apply

Apply when preparing or updating companion content in another language. The decision is how to make
that reading version clear to human reviewers without turning it into a second canonical Pack. The
canonical Practice IDs, runtime files, and intended decision remain the shared reference.

## Guidance

Translate the decision, not the English word order. Preserve the Practice ID, anti-pattern ID,
trigger conditions, required action, stopping point, exceptions, causal reason, and example
relationships. Replace an idiom or unfamiliar term with natural language in the target language when
the meaning stays the same. Keep localized files outside the canonical runtime input according to
the repository’s localization layout, and record which canonical revision each translation
represents. Have a target-language reviewer check both readability and meaning against the canonical
file. Stop when every localized Practice is current, reviewable, and traceable to one canonical
Practice; do not add language-specific runtime rules merely to make the translation feel more
useful.

## Anti-pattern

A compliance Pack is translated for regional reviewers. The canonical Practice says to retain
customer records for the period defined by the applicable policy and to escalate conflicting rules.
A local reviewer asks for a concrete number, and the translator knows that one business unit
commonly uses seven years. Adding “seven years” only to the translation seems helpful and saves a
policy lookup. It also creates a second rule that can outlive the business-unit policy and
contradict the canonical trigger for other users.

## Why

Natural localization lets humans catch unclear guidance and domain mistakes. A runtime fork does the
opposite: the same Practice ID would imply different decisions depending on which file a reader saw,
and fixes would have no single source to update.

## Exceptions and boundaries

A localized note may explain a term, regulation name, or example for readers when it is clearly
marked as non-canonical context and does not change the decision. A market-specific rule that should
affect runtime behavior belongs in its own canonical Practice or Pack with an explicit trigger, not
in a translation. This Practice does not require literal sentence alignment.

## Example

A database-operations Pack uses the English phrase “fail closed” in a Practice about restoring
access controls after recovery. The Chinese reviewer finds a literal translation unclear. The
translator rewrites it as a concrete instruction: if the permission state cannot be verified, keep
access denied and ask an operator to resolve it. The Practice and anti-pattern IDs stay unchanged,
the example preserves the same recovery sequence, and the localization record points to the reviewed
canonical revision. No localized file is added to the runtime Pack root.
