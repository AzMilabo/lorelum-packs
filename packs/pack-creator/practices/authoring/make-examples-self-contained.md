title: Make Each Example Understandable on Its Own
---

## When to apply

Apply while drafting or cold-reading the Example section. The Example must carry the facts needed to
understand one correct application without access to meetings, source documents, or earlier
Practices. Whole-Practice independence is a design concern; this Practice focuses only on the
scenario inside Example.

## Guidance

State the Pack goal relevant to the scenario, the source or system facts that constrain the choice,
the plausible alternative, and why the selected action is better. Replace unexplained internal names
with their functional relationship. Include only facts that change the decision. Stop when a cold
reader can retell the request, constraint, choice, and result without asking what a local acronym or
past incident means.

## Anti-pattern

A security Pack is based on an outage in which a message broker, not the application, owned retry
timing. Reviewers know it as the Omega incident, so the author writes, "As in Omega, keep the owner
in the right layer." The reference feels concise and preserves team history, but a new engineer
cannot tell what was owned, which layer made the wrong choice, or how to apply the lesson to another
broker.

## Why

Lorelum may retrieve one Practice far from its original source context. Missing relationships force
the reader to guess, and that guess can reverse the intended decision even when the example sounds
familiar to its author.

## Exceptions and boundaries

Public standards and universally understood terms may be named directly when their relevant rule is
also stated. Do not reproduce confidential incident details; anonymize names while preserving roles,
constraints, and causality. Extra chronology or decorative data should be removed when it does not
affect the choice.

## Example

A compliance Pack helps importers preserve valid marketing consent. The source policy requires both
the time and source of consent, while the CRM accepts blank values. Rather than defaulting missing
fields to import time, which would create false evidence, the Example shows the importer
quarantining incomplete records for review. The policy fact, tempting shortcut, and correct boundary
are all present.
